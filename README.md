# London-Airbnb-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyses Airbnb listings in London to uncover insights into pricing, guest satisfaction, and property features. The aim is to support data-driven decision-making for hosts, guests and investors by leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The primary dataset is sourced from [Kaggleâ€™s London Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). It includes listing details, reviews and location data. Additional external data sources were considered for enrichment but not integrated in the final analysis.

## Key Insights

- **Price Drivers:** Location, room type, and number of reviews significantly influence listing prices.  
- **Guest Sentiment:** Positive reviews often highlight cleanliness and host responsiveness.  
- **Clustering:** Airbnb listings cluster into distinct groups based on price and review patterns, revealing market segments.  
- **Predictive Models:** Tree-based regressors outperform linear models in predicting prices and identifying outliers.
