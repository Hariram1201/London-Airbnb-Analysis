# London-Airbnb-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb listings in London to uncover insights into pricing, guest satisfaction, and property features. The aim is to support data-driven decision-making for hosts, guests, and investors by leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques.

## Key Insights

- **Price Drivers:** Location, room type, and number of reviews significantly influence listing prices.  
- **Guest Sentiment:** Positive reviews often highlight cleanliness and host responsiveness.  
- **Clustering:** Airbnb listings cluster into distinct groups based on price and review patterns, revealing market segments.  
- **Predictive Models:** Tree-based regressors outperform linear models in predicting prices and identifying outliers.  

## Future Work

- Integrate demographic and local event data for richer analysis.  
- Deploy models for dynamic pricing recommendations.  
- Enhance sentiment analysis with more advanced NLP techniques.  
- Develop interactive dashboards for end-users.
